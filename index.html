			<h2>Projects</h2>
			
			<h3>Comparative Study of Machine Learning Algorithms on Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews 	</h3>
			<p>Spring 2019</br>
			Making machines understand human sentiments would allow us to analyse millions of product reviews that exist on sites like Amazon.<br>
			The text reviews were preprocessed and the Bag of Words model was used for feature extraction. We applied various Machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, etc. and analysed the results.<br>
			We created a voted classifier using the mode of the votes of the ML models to obtain a better-performing classifier.<br>
			Published "Comparative Study of Machine Learning Algorithms on Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews" in the Book ICT for Competitive Strategies - Dec 2019</p>
			<h3>Comparison of Search Algorithms for Autonomous Mobile Rescue Robot	</h3>
			</p>
			CSCI 5511: Artificial Intelligence I (Fall 2022)<br>
			Our goal was to identify effective path-planning algorithms for Rescue robots to detect and make decisions based on various obstacles and topographical perturbations.<br>
			We simulated the robot environment for the Rescue Robot using OpenCV and implemented search and sampling-based algorithms for target localization and path planning.<br>
			The sampling-based algorithms were able to plan paths much faster due to the lower number of nodes.</p>
